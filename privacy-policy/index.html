								<p>We will collect and process the following data about you:
								</p><br>
								<ul>
									<li>Information you give us. This is information (including Identity, Contact, Financial, and Marketing and Communications Data) you consent to giving us about you by filling in forms on the App Site and the Services Sites (together “Our Sites”), or by corresponding with us (for example, by email or chat). It includes information you provide when you register to use the App Site, download or register an App, subscribe to any of our Services, search for an App or Service, make orders, share data via an App’s social media functions, enter a competition, prize draw, promotion or survey, and when you report a problem with an App, our Services, or any of Our Sites. If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence for a time period of three (3) years.</li>
									<br>
									<li>Information we collect about you and your device. Each time you visit one of Our Sites or use one of our Apps we will automatically collect personal data including your IP, Content and Usage Data. We collect this data using cookies and other similar technologies. Please see our cookie policy [LINK] for further details.</li>
									<br>
									<li>Location Data. We also use your device’s location services to determine your current location. Some of our location-enabled Services require your personal data for the feature to work.

									<li>Device Data from the following parties:</li>
									<br>
									<li>analytics providers [such as Facebook and Google based outside the EU];</li>
									<br>
									<li>advertising networks [such as Google or Facebook based inside and/or outside the EU]; and</li>

									<br>
									<li>P and usage information via crash reporting platform Firebase Crashlytics (owned by Google)

									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="b">COOKIES</p>
								<p>We use cookies [and/or other tracking technologies] to distinguish you from other users of the App, App Site, the distribution platform (Appstore) or Services Sites and to remember your preferences. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use the App or browse any of Our Sites and also allows us to improve the App and Our Sites. For detailed information on the cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and how you can exercise your choices regarding our use of your cookies, see our cookie policy [LINK].

                <dd>
                  Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services.
                  You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it
                  by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and
                  receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from
                  third parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement the data we collect by
                  purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us
                  determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location.
                  The data we collect depends on the services and features you use.
                </dd>
                <dt class="heading-4">HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
								</dt>
								<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so. Most commonly we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
								<p>Where you have consented before the processing.</p>
								<p>Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter or have entered with you.</p>
								<p>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</p>
								<p>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</p>

                <dd>
                  Our web site uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and provide
                  (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications, including
                  promotional communications, and to display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine
                  data we collect through the various web site services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent
                  and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and
                  procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we
                  collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information
                  that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.
                </dd>
                <dt class="heading-4">Sharing Your Information</dt>
                <dd>
                  We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide
                  any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties
                  when you tell us to do so. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment
                  data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial
                  services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In addition, we share personal data
                  among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents
                  working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired
                  to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may
                  need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must
                  abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they
                  receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate
                  transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
